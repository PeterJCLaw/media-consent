This form serves two main purposes: the creation of Student Robotics user accounts, and informing us of your media consent.
A user account will give you access to the Student Robotics web-based development environment, the forums, and it will also let you download a ticket to attend the competition.
Your account details will be emailed to you when your form has been processed.
Please ensure you use an email address you have access to both in and out of term time.

\textbf{Are you a team leader or competitor?}
A team leader is a responsible adult in charge of a team of competitors.
It is the responsibility of the team leader to ensure any requirements of the school, college or organisation the competitors are associated with are met.
For most teams, this will be a teacher.\\[2mm]
